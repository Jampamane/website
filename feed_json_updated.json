I wasn't going to wait around for each DVD to arrive in the mail, so I found a website online called <code>watchfreetv.com</code> or something. This is also how I watched <strong>The IT Crowd</strong>.</p>\n<p>My wife and I are currently in the process of watching the show again. She's seen it like 5 times already, but this is only my second viewing. It's interesting to notice the things I remember from the first viewing, and the things that hit me differently now a decade later.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-05-08T15:11:40+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Brandow"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/05/the-first-post/", "url": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/05/the-first-post/", "title": "The First Post", "content_html": "<p>It's overcast today.</p>\n<p>Here I am, sitting at work looking out the window wondering why I'm starting this blog in the first place.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I supervised my 3 year old son as he painted a picture. The picture in question was, as you can imagine, just a bunch of water colored blobs on a page. For a while he mixed the colors, practiced holding a paintbrush, and named each color in wonder as he put them on the paper. When he was finished working on his own, he handed me a paintbrush. I helped him fill in the gaps and smooth out the colors while he continued to add more paint to the page.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-05-08T13:11:56+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Brandow"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/07/i-used-to-be-mormon/", "url": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/07/i-used-to-be-mormon/", "title": "I Used to be Mormon", "content_html": "<p>It wasn\u2019t going to go away, no matter how much I tried not to think about it.

My wife, fighting an unknown sickness, would not be joining me. Without her voice to fill the silence my mind drifts into a hypothetical future. I think about a future where we have our own washer and dryer. I think about a future where I'm not in college and I don't need to rely on my parents. I think about a future where I don't need to drive 40 minutes to do laundry.</p>\n<p>Pulling into my parents driveway I notice both of their cars are gone. I\u2019m admittedly relieved, as this means I can have a nice and quiet day of folding clothes.
