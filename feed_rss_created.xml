The picture in question was, as you can imagine, just a bunch of water colored blobs on a page. For a while he mixed the colors, practiced holding a paintbrush, and named each color in wonder as he put them on the paper. When he was finished working on his own, he handed me a paintbrush. I helped him fill in the gaps and smooth out the colors while he continued to add more paint to the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/05/the-first-post/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 22:07:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.jampamane.org/feed_rss_created.xml">Jampamane</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/05/the-first-post/</guid> </item> <item> <title>I Used to be Mormon</title> <author>Jeremy Brandow</author> <description>&lt;h1&gt;I Used to be Mormon&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t going to go away, no matter how much I tried not to think about it. The thought had taken permanent residence on a shelf in my brain titled: &lt;em&gt;Future Problems&lt;/em&gt;. It was a future problem that was fast approaching, like a knife wielding horror cliche chasing me in the forest, who just now broke out into a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was having trouble describing what I was feeling. It was a kind of fear mixed with uncertainty? And then pan tossed with insecurity? Is this what anxiety felt like? Wasn’t I just in High School? Wasn’t graduation only a month ago? I had already said goodbye to my graduating class, and now I have to say goodbye to my friends and family?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/07/i-used-to-be-mormon/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 22:07:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.jampamane.org/feed_rss_created.xml">Jampamane</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/03/07/i-used-to-be-mormon/</guid> </item> </channel></rss>
