I guess we weren't the only ones with the brilliant idea of jumping into a giant tub of cold water to beat the heat.</p>\n<p>I have fond memories of this pool. I would frequent the twirly tube slide, float through the lazy river, and attempt flips off of the diving board. This particular trip, however, provided me with a different kind of memory. One of great panic and fear.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2025-09-17T14:23:05+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Brandow"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/07/21/i-dont-forgive-you/", "url": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/07/21/i-dont-forgive-you/", "title": "I Don't Forgive You", "content_html": "<p>Yesterday my wife and I started watching a new show called <em>Mom</em>. The story focuses on Anna Faris' character and her stuggles to be a good mother. Ofter she blames her bad parenting on her own mother, who has just recently come back into her life.</p>\n<p>The show is, at the end of the day, a sitcom. It does tackle themes of addiciton, drug use, and becoming a better parent, but it does so in a comedic, sitcom-y way. Sometimes this works really well, but other times it falls flat.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2025-07-21T15:54:01+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Brandow"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/07/08/burnout/", "url": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/07/08/burnout/", "title": "Burnout", "content_html": "<p>Recently I've been feeling the tiring effects of burnout.</p>\n<p>Whenever something like this happens I like to drown out my feelings with noise, usually in the form of YouTube videos. I have a sneaking suspicion that that is more common of a response than any one of us would care to admit. It's uncomfortable to marinate in negative feelings and really get to the root of why they're there in the first place. The much easier path is to put the entertainment box in front of our face so that we can forget, even for a moment, that they exist.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2025-07-08T17:23:13+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Brandow"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/05/08/the-countdown/", "url": "https://www.jampamane.org/blog/2025/05/08/the-countdown/", "title": "The Countdown", "content_html": "<p>Sometime in middle school I decided to watch <strong>How I Met Your Mother</strong>.</p>\n<p>Netflix was in a transition period, and was still sending physical disks to people's houses.

My wife, fighting an unknown sickness, would not be joining me. Without her voice to fill the silence my mind drifts into a hypothetical future. I think about a future where we have our own washer and dryer. I think about a future where I'm not in college and I don't need to rely on my parents. I think about a future where I don't need to drive 40 minutes to do laundry.</p>\n<p>Pulling into my parents driveway I notice both of their cars are gone.

For a while he mixed the colors, practiced holding a paintbrush, and named each color in wonder as he put them on the paper. When he was finished working on his own, he handed me a paintbrush. I helped him fill in the gaps and smooth out the colors while he continued to add more paint to the page.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2025-03-05T18:32:31+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Brandow"}], "tags": null}]}
