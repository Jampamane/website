    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jeremy and recently I have been experiementing with creating and designing websites. I figured it would be convenient to create one myself so that I can tie together my professional work history and my blog, which encompasses all of my personal projects.</p>
    <h2>Why Jampamane?</h2>
    <p>In the mid 2000s, I remember sitting at the computer in the carpeted office that my parents turned into the computer room. Prior to this, the only other thing I had registered for was Roblox. To me, <code>thejampakkid</code> looked and felt clunky. I wanted something new, something sleek. My eyes were fixated on the blinking cursor inside the sign up box to Runescape. Wanting to take inspiration from my previous username, I took the middle section and created <code>jampamane</code>. It's been nearly 2 decades since that moment, and the username stuck.</p>
    <h2>My Youtube Channel</h2>
    <p>In the early 2010s, I started posting videos to my Youtube channel. I was 12 at the time so... these were not good videos. Some time in high school I got really embarassed about them and deleted them all. That was a decision I wish I hadn't made, because looking back on truly terrible content can help you see how far you've come. The only evidence that they even existed remain on an old Twitter account I no longer have access to. Now my channel consists of a myriad of things: assignments in highschool, commentary videos I made in college, gaming challenges I streamed on Twitch, etc.</p>
    <h2>After College</h2>
    <p>In 2023, I graduated from Utah Valley University with a bachelors degree in Information Systems. Currently I am married with a kid and I am working full time. It can be hard to find the time to make any kind of content on the internet, but I try and find a little bit of time every day.</p>
