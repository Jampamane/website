My name is Jeremy and recently I have been experiementing with creating and designing websites. I figured it would be convenient to create one myself so that I can tie together my professional work history and my blog, which encompasses all of my personal projects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why Jampamane?</p> <p>In the mid 2000s, I remember sitting at the computer in the carpeted office that my parents turned into the computer room. Prior to this, the only other thing I had registered for was Roblox. To me, <code>thejampakkid</code> looked and felt clunky. I wanted something new, something sleek. My eyes were fixated on the blinking cursor inside the sign up box to Runescape. Wanting to take inspiration from my previous username, I took the middle section and created <code>jampamane</code>. It's been nearly 2 decades since that moment, and the username stuck.</p> </li> <li> <p>My Youtube Channel</p> <p>In the early 2010s, I started posting videos to my Youtube channel. I was 12 at the time so... these were not good videos. Some time in high school I got really embarassed about them and deleted them all. That was a decision I wish I hadn't made, because looking back on truly terrible content can help you see how far you've come. The only evidence that they even existed remain on an old Twitter account I no longer have access to. Now my channel consists of a myriad of things: assignments in highschool, commentary videos I made in college, gaming challenges I streamed on Twitch, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>After College</p> <p>In 2023, I graduated from Utah Valley University with a bachelors degree in Information Systems. Currently I am married with a kid and I am working full time. It can be hard to find the time to make any kind of content on the internet, but I try and find a little bit of time every day.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/03/05/the-first-post/","title":"The First Post","text":"<p>It's overcast today.</p> <p>Here I am, sitting at work looking out the window wondering why I'm starting this blog in the first place.</p> <p>Yesterday I supervised my 3 year old son as he painted a picture. The picture in question was, as you can imagine, just a bunch of water colored blobs on a page. For a while he mixed the colors, practiced holding a paintbrush, and named each color in wonder as he put them on the paper. When he was finished working on his own, he handed me a paintbrush. I helped him fill in the gaps and smooth out the colors while he continued to add more paint to the page.</p> <p>Once we were done I put it on the counter to let it dry, after which my wife cut it in a square and put it in a picture frame. The end result, I think, actually looks pretty good, but that isn't the point. My son was so excited to paint something, more excited I think than he usually is to watch TV or go to the park. His eyes widened and his face lit up when we asked him if he wanted to paint. He now looks at his picture in the frame, points at it, and happily calls it his painting.</p> <p>While supervising him in all this I saw this innocent kind of whimsy and joy you get from simply creating art. We painted a picture together, not because we were trying to profit off of it, and not because it was our job, but because it was fun. We created a piece of artwork simply for the sake of creating art.</p> <p>I haven't done that in a while.</p> <p>In highschool I really loved English, and even thought about becoming an English teacher for a bit. I don't remember everything I learned in Mr. Rees' classroom, but I do remember looking forward to his class every day. He taught me to view the world analytically, how to build a compelling argument, and that there are real life, morally ambiguous events that don't have easy answers. We would write every morning we came to his class, not for a grade, but for the sake of putting words to paper.</p> <p>That's what I want to recreate with this blog. I need to rediscover the joy and sense of accomplishment you get from creating art, not through any kind of AI, but through actually writing. I think the point of creating something is less in the end result and more in the process itself, a point which can easily be forgotten in this day in age. Why do the hard work of expressing yourself when you can have a <code>Large Language Model</code> do all the talking for you? Sure, it's a lot easier to do that, but creating art inherently takes work. </p> <p>It's a challenging kind of work, it's a creative kind of work, and it's a different kind of work, but it's the kind of work we should all be doing, because maybe hedonism isn't all that it's cracked up to be.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/03/07/i-used-to-be-mormon/","title":"I Used to be Mormon","text":"<p>It wasn\u2019t going to go away, no matter how much I tried not to think about it. The thought had taken permanent residence on a shelf in my brain titled: Future Problems. It was a future problem that was fast approaching, like a knife wielding horror cliche chasing me in the forest, who just now broke out into a sprint.</p> <p>I was having trouble describing what I was feeling. It was a kind of fear mixed with uncertainty? And then pan tossed with insecurity? Is this what anxiety felt like? Wasn\u2019t I just in High School? Wasn\u2019t graduation only a month ago? I had already said goodbye to my graduating class, and now I have to say goodbye to my friends and family?</p> <p>I looked down at the floor where all of my belongings lie, then to the empty closet where they were just a moment ago. My bed sank as I sat on the edge of it, seemingly burdened by the extra weight of my thoughts. My room was suddenly a mess. Maybe if I sat and stared at my stuff for long enough, it would magically pack itself, or better yet, it\u2019d go back into the closet where it's always been. This wishful thinking was interrupted by my mom, who has walked into my room to ask me a question.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the packing coming along?\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth to speak but nothing comes out. Just one word would do the trick; good, or fine, or even bad would suffice. No need to make a scene.</p> <p>Suddenly I\u2019m crying.</p> <p>This catches me off guard, as I had never cried from fear and stress before. It\u2019s also extremely uncharacteristic of me to cry in front of my mom like this. My mom knows this too. Clearly sensing something was off, she tried to comfort me.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to go if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at her for a minute wondering if she actually believed what she just said. All this work to get to this point just to back out at the last second? All of the worthiness tests and the bishopric meetings and the priesthood blessings and the tithing money paid just so I could go to college for a year? No, it\u2019s too late to turn back.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to be a Mormon missionary for 2 years of my life.</p> <p>After I assured my mom that everything was fine, she left. Then I placed all my things into my comically large suitcase. It\u2019s a strange thing, living out of a suitcase for 2 years, constantly moving from place to place, never really having somewhere to call home. Just drifting in and out of people's stories without a care in the world. Why fully unpack your things when you\u2019re just going to have to move again? Then again, why even think about unpacking a suitcase right now? I just finished packing. There\u2019s a million things I still needed to get done, yet all I could seem to muster the energy to do was sit on the edge of my bed and stare at my suitcase.</p> <p>What I\u2019m describing isn\u2019t unique; thousands of people decide to go on missions every year. You're treated with honor and respect, and you return home a local hero. God has commanded to go and teach the world the truth. We sing about this moment in church when we're children. I hope they call me on a mission, when I have grown a foot or two. People do this kind of thing because they genuinely believe in what they\u2019re teaching.</p> <p></p> <p>I went on a mission because I believed in the Mormon church. I believed, perhaps naively, that the Mormon church was the only true church on the planet. I taught people about Joseph Smith. I baptized people. I knocked on lots and lots of doors. I listened to cheesy Christian bands. I handed out the Book of Mormon. I called my family twice a year. I prayed every night. I went to bed at 10:30. I got 8 hours of sleep. I played a lot of basketball. I wrote in my journal.</p> <p>I was a good Mormon missionary.</p> <p>Growing up we were taught that people who stop believing are \u201cdeceived by Satan\u201d or \u201cfell for anti-Mormon literature\u201d or \u201cwere lazy and just wanted to sin\u201d or \u201cwere offended by the people\u201d etc, etc\u2026</p> <p>So then did any of those things happen to me?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>I left because the Mormon church isn\u2019t true.</p> <p>They\u2019ll tell you about all of these \"reasons\" that people leave to try and discredit the people who left. The truth is, in order to honestly comprehend that people leave the Mormon church because of flaws in it's history or doctrine, means admitting that those flaws exist in the first place. The Mormon church, however, has no flaws, at least according to them.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never forget the time I found out the Mormon church lied to me.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way an uneducated farm boy could write such a complicated and convincing tale as the Book of Mormon in only 60 days! It had to have come from God!\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ll hear this argument a lot. I have heard this argument more times than I can count. I told this to people while on my mission.</p> <p>I would like to now turn your attention away from the Book of Mormon briefly, and towards a different book, in a different time. One that was published a decade prior to the release of the Book of Mormon. This book is titled The Late War. It\u2019s a historical textbook written in an old style of English, similar to that of the Book of Mormon. So similar, in fact, that doing a side by side comparison reveals a singularly laughable fact. Large swaths of the Book of Mormon were very clearly plagiarized from this book. Not only that, but this was a book that is widely believed to have been owned by Joseph Smith himself.</p> <p>There I was, a struggling college student in my studio apartment, doing the side by side comparison of the two books whilst my newborn son napped in the crib behind me. My jaw hung open in disbelief as I read. \u201cThe single most important piece of evidence for the restoration of the gospel\u201d was falling apart right in front of me. My brain broke. The glass chair I was sitting on shattered and I was suddenly falling 168 stories to my death. The world started to spin.</p> <p>I know it sounds a bit hyperbolic but my whole entire belief system came crashing down. There was nothing left. I stood there in the ashes wondering what I could possibly rebuild with.</p> <p>To this day my parents think I \u201cread some anti Mormon stuff online.\u201d We don\u2019t really talk about it. Maybe we never will. They\u2019ve dedicated close to half a century worth of time to the Mormon church. I was lucky enough to learn the truth in my early twenties, I can\u2019t image what it would do to a person in their sixties. Perhaps it\u2019s better if they never learn the truth. All their friends, large chunks of their identity, and their whole community is Mormon. Maybe they\u2019d be too proud to listen to what I have to say. I don\u2019t even know if I want to try to tell them.</p> <p>I wanted the church to be true. I wanted the community, I miss the community. I miss knowing \u201cwhat the purpose of life is.\u201d I wanted to believe in continuing revelation and modern day prophets. I loved the beautiful bubble that was Utah county. I enjoyed going to church and singing weird cult-y songs about Joseph Smith being a Martyr. But it\u2019s impossible to unsee something.</p> <p>Once you pull back the curtain to reveal a man operating the levers to what you once believed moments ago was a great and powerful wizard, you can\u2019t just close the curtain and pretend everything is fine.</p> <p>Ignorance is bliss.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/03/11/laundry/","title":"Laundry","text":"<p>Sunday had arrived once again.</p> <p>I loaded up the car with 2 weeks worth of laundry and pulled out of the apartment complex. My wife, fighting an unknown sickness, would not be joining me. Without her voice to fill the silence my mind drifts into a hypothetical future. I think about a future where we have our own washer and dryer. I think about a future where I'm not in college and I don't need to rely on my parents. I think about a future where I don't need to drive 40 minutes to do laundry.</p> <p>Pulling into my parents driveway I notice both of their cars are gone. I\u2019m admittedly relieved, as this means I can have a nice and quiet day of folding clothes. This, however, makes me feel guilty, as I don\u2019t get to see my parents that often anymore.</p> <p>Regardless of my feelings I came here to do a job, so I step out of my car, grab all the clothes, and pile the mountain of laundry in front of the washing machine.</p> <p>After several hours I had almost finished. I had just pulled out a clean load of clothes from the dryer and was in the middle of folding one of my shirts when my dad walked in the front door. I wasn't expecting to see him, but this was his home after all. We greet each other, and after several more minutes of pleasantries he revealed what was really on his mind.</p> <p>He asked why I hadn't been wearing my garments.</p> <p>Now, for the uninitiated, garments are sacred Mormon underwear. I wish I was kidding, but that's literally what it is. Mormon's will go into this big white building and do a bunch of totally not culty stuff and tell God that they promise to wear their new magic underwear.</p> <p>My dad is asking his fully grown son why he isn\u2019t wearing his magic underwear.</p> <p>I know that sounds really bizarre, and it is, but failure to equip the sacred garments of the holy priesthood could be a sign I\u2019m falling away from the Mormon church. That means I won\u2019t be with them in the eternities. I would be the sole reason my entire family is broken up in heaven. It's kind of a big deal. I knew this moment was coming too, I mean we do laundry at their house. It was only a matter of time before they noticed that our laundry no longer included any garments.</p> <p>My dad probes me a bit.</p> <p>\u201dSo do you just not like them, or do you not believe in them anymore?\u201d</p> <p>He says the second option in a sort of a joking manner, which makes it obvious to me that it\u2019s not an actual option in his mind. I mean, how could his own son jeopardize his eternal family? That's just the kind of dumb thing his son wouldn't do. His own son obviously wouldn\u2019t do that.</p> <p>It takes me a long time to answer him, longer than it should have taken to answer his rhetorical question. Agonizing seconds pass as I scramble for an answer. I can see the concern on his face developing.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to tell him.</p> <p>He\u2019ll be so disappointed.</p> <p>I really don\u2019t want to tell him.</p> <p>This isn't fair, I mean he practically blindsided me with this question. It's like I\u2019m a feral animal and he\u2019s backed me into a corner. I knew we we're going to have this conversation eventually but that didn't mean it had to be today. I wasn't ready yet. Maybe if I had just shown up earlier I could have finished my laundry by now and avoided this all together.</p> <p>Finally, the words manage to escape my mouth. They come out hesitantly and quietly, so quiet I could barely hear myself.</p> <p>I tell him I don\u2019t believe anymore.</p> <p>The moment the words come out of my mouth my dad's face shifts into a pained expression, like a cross between horror and sadness with just a hint of betrayal. What strikes me the most is how shocked he is. He seems genuinely surprised that I would say something like this.</p> <p>Before I have a chance to process this he\u2019s asking me why. Why would I do this? What happened?</p> <p>I begin to explain the research I did into church history, but before I could even finish a sentence he interrupts me.</p> <p>\u201dSo you read anti-Mormon material?\u201d</p> <p>This is a predictable response, but it still catches me offguard. Anti-Mormon material is the first item in a faithful member's arsenal to dismiss any historical facts that directly contridict what the Mormon church teaches. It's an extremely effective thought-stopping technique. Maybe I just thought that my dad wouldn't stoop to that level. Maybe I thought he would try and actually understand my concerns instead of dismissing them all because I read \u201canti-Mormon material.\u201d Maybe I was wrong.</p> <p>Recognizing that nothing I could say would change his mind, I stop talking. He tells me that he\u2019s heard ALL the \u201canti-Mormon lies\u201d back when he served his Mormon mission in California. This was, of course, back before the internet existed. I just stand there and let him talk, slightly dumbfounded at the words he's saying.</p> <p>When he's finished monologuing I make one last ditch attempt to get through to him. I tell him that I don\u2019t like the way the Mormon church treats gay people. He seems to have a prepared response for this. He tells me that he thinks being gay is a mental illness. That when you\u2019re gay you\u2019re \u201cpurposefully removing yourself from the gene pool.\u201d He tells me that \"you wouldn\u2019t enable the behavior of someone who is bipolar, so we shouldn't enable the behavior of gay people.\"</p> <p>I think about this response often. At the time I had never heard of this argument, but it sounded ignorant at best and malicious at worst. Reflecting on this now, several years later, I realize this kind of belief is a byproduct of believing in the teachings of Mormonism. Obviously that doesn't make it right, but I can at least direct my anger at the Mormon corporation and not my father.</p> <p>Just to clarify, being gay IS NOT a mental illness as evidenced by a couple of things.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1974.</p> </li> <li> <p>The logic of this argument falls apart under scrutiny. So it's only bad because you're purposefully removing yourself from the gene pool? So straight couples in their 40s who chose not to have kids are actually mentally ill?</p> </li> <li> <p>Believing that homosexuality is bad because gay people are having sex knowing that they'll never reproduce means that you believe the only reason to have sex is to reproduce. Can't use a condom because I know it won't result in a baby. Guess that means if I use a condom I have a mental illness, right?</p> </li> <li> <p>Hey dad, if you and mom have had sex any time in the last decade that means you had sex knowing that the primary reason wasn't to reproduce which means, by your own logic, you have a mental illness.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These are all points that I wish I had brought up in the moment. I can really only take solace in the fact that it probably wouldn't have made any difference in his mind.</p> <p>By this time we're sitting on the front porch. The concrete steps are warm from the heat of the sun. I sat there listening to the sounds of the birds when I realized my dad had finished talking. A silence had occupied the space between us as I had nothing left to say to him.</p> <p>My mom's car pulls into the driveway. Not wanting to have this conversation in front of her, my dad tells me we'll talk later. We greet my mom and go inside to finish my laundry. Both of my parents help me fold the last load. I am now hyper aware that it does not include any garments. They help me load up the car and I hug them goodbye.</p> <p>The radio is turned off on the drive home. Without my wife's voice to fill the silence my mind drifts into a hypothetical future. I think about a future where my dad doesn't fall victim to demonstrably false lies. I think about a future where I can share a beer with my dad and we can sit on the porch and just talk. I think about a future where I can be myself in front of my parents.</p> <p>I think about a future that is never going to happen.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/04/15/surgery/","title":"Surgery","text":"<p>My mom had to get hip surgery.</p> <p>Apparently she has genetically bad hips. Her and her 3 sisters are all dealing with this fact. One of them is currently trying alternative methods to try and fix it: things like stem cells, and hyperbaric chambers and whatnot.</p> <p>My mom is 54 years old and had to get hip surgery.</p> <p>My dad was texting me updates while I was at work: \u201cThe surgery went fine\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re in the recovery room\u201d, \u201cHer blood pressure is normal\u201d. Just a routine surgery that went according to plan, I thought. I told my dad that I would call him after work.</p> <p>It had only been 2 hours. I called my dad and he answered with a \u2018hello\u2019  like he normally would. I didn\u2019t sense any distress in his voice, so I said \u201cWhat up?\u201d in a cheery tone.</p> <p>\u201cWell, not good.\u201d</p> <p>He starts to break down as he explains that she was taken into an emergency surgery because her blood pressure was dropping. That shockwave of disbelief hit me, the kind you only feel while receiving bad news. It\u2019s like getting punched in the nerves in the back of your head, and shoots through the rest of your body.</p> <p>I should say that my mom is okay, but she very nearly died. Her femoral artery was nicked during the first surgery and she was bleeding internally.</p> <p>When we didn\u2019t know if she was going to be okay, this thing happened to me. The same thing happened when my wife was giving birth and she was taken into an emergency c-section. My brain would not allow me to imagine what life would be like if they were gone. I literally could not even will myself to think about it. If that option did not, and could not exist, then nothing bad was going to happen. They weren\u2019t even gone and I was already going through the first stage of grief.</p> <p>This whole thing got me thinking about the last conversation we had. I tried to call her the day before the surgery but she didn\u2019t answer, and I didn\u2019t try to call her again. Life distracted me with something else, and I didn\u2019t try too hard to call her again.
