My name is Jeremy and recently I have been experiementing with creating and designing websites. I figured it would be convenient to create one myself so that I can tie together my professional work history and my blog, which encompasses all of my personal projects. Why Jampamane? In the mid 2000s, I remember sitting at the computer in the carpeted office that my parents turned into the computer room. Prior to this, the only other thing I had registered for was Roblox. To me, <code>thejampakkid</code> looked and felt clunky. I wanted something new, something sleek. My eyes were fixated on the blinking cursor inside the sign up box to Runescape. Wanting to take inspiration from my previous username, I took the middle section and created <code>jampamane</code>. It's been nearly 2 decades since that moment, and the username stuck. My Youtube Channel In the early 2010s, I started posting videos to my Youtube channel. I was 12 at the time so... these were not good videos. Some time in high school I got really embarassed about them and deleted them all. That was a decision I wish I hadn't made, because looking back on truly terrible content can help you see how far you've come. The only evidence that they even existed remain on an old Twitter account I no longer have access to. Now my channel consists of a myriad of things: assignments in highschool, commentary videos I made in college, gaming challenges I streamed on Twitch, etc. After College In 2023, I graduated from Utah Valley University with a bachelors degree in Information Systems. Currently I am married with a kid and I am working full time. It can be hard to find the time to make any kind of content on the internet, but I try and find a little bit of time every day."},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/03/05/the-first-post/","title":"The First Post","text":"<p>It's overcast today.</p> <p>Here I am, sitting at work looking out the window wondering why I'm starting this blog in the first place.</p> <p>Yesterday I supervised my 3 year old son as he painted a picture. The picture in question was, as you can imagine, just a bunch of water colored blobs on a page. For a while he mixed the colors, practiced holding a paintbrush, and named each color in wonder as he put them on the paper. When he was finished working on his own, he handed me a paintbrush. I helped him fill in the gaps and smooth out the colors while he continued to add more paint to the page.</p> <p>Once we were done I put it on the counter to let it dry, after which my wife cut it in a square and put it in a picture frame. The end result, I think, actually looks pretty good, but that isn't the point. My son was so excited to paint something, more excited I think than he usually is to watch TV or go to the park. His eyes widened and his face lit up when we asked him if he wanted to paint. He now looks at his picture in the frame, points at it, and happily calls it his painting.</p> <p>While supervising him in all this I saw this innocent kind of whimsy and joy you get from simply creating art. We painted a picture together, not because we were trying to profit off of it, and not because it was our job, but because it was fun. We created a piece of artwork simply for the sake of creating art.</p> <p>I haven't done that in a while.</p> <p>In highschool I really loved English, and even thought about becoming an English teacher for a bit. I don't remember everything I learned in Mr. Rees' classroom, but I do remember looking forward to his class every day. He taught me to view the world analytically, how to build a compelling argument, and that there are real life, morally ambiguous events that don't have easy answers. We would write every morning we came to his class, not for a grade, but for the sake of putting words to paper.</p> <p>That's what I want to recreate with this blog. I need to rediscover the joy and sense of accomplishment you get from creating art, not through any kind of AI, but through actually writing. I think the point of creating something is less in the end result and more in the process itself, a point which can easily be forgotten in this day in age. Why do the hard work of expressing yourself when you can have a <code>Large Language Model</code> do all the talking for you? Sure, it's a lot easier to do that, but creating art inherently takes work. </p> <p>It's a challenging kind of work, it's a creative kind of work, and it's a different kind of work, but it's the kind of work we should all be doing, because maybe hedonism isn't all that it's cracked up to be.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/03/07/i-used-to-be-mormon/","title":"I Used to be Mormon","text":"<p>It wasn\u2019t going to go away, no matter how much I tried not to think about it. The thought had taken permanent residence on a shelf in my brain titled: Future Problems. It was a future problem that was fast approaching, like a knife wielding horror cliche chasing me in the forest, who just now broke out into a sprint.</p> <p>I was having trouble describing what I was feeling. It was a kind of fear mixed with uncertainty? And then pan tossed with insecurity? Is this what anxiety felt like? Wasn\u2019t I just in High School? Wasn\u2019t graduation only a month ago? I had already said goodbye to my graduating class, and now I have to say goodbye to my friends and family?</p> <p>I looked down at the floor where all of my belongings lie, then to the empty closet where they were just a moment ago. My bed sank as I sat on the edge of it, seemingly burdened by the extra weight of my thoughts. My room was suddenly a mess. Maybe if I sat and stared at my stuff for long enough, it would magically pack itself, or better yet, it\u2019d go back into the closet where it's always been. This wishful thinking was interrupted by my mom, who has walked into my room to ask me a question.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the packing coming along?\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth to speak but nothing comes out. Just one word would do the trick; good, or fine, or even bad would suffice. No need to make a scene.</p> <p>Suddenly I\u2019m crying.</p> <p>This catches me off guard, as I had never cried from fear and stress before. It\u2019s also extremely uncharacteristic of me to cry in front of my mom like this. My mom knows this too. Clearly sensing something was off, she tried to comfort me.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to go if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at her for a minute wondering if she actually believed what she just said. All this work to get to this point just to back out at the last second? All of the worthiness tests and the bishopric meetings and the priesthood blessings and the tithing money paid just so I could go to college for a year? No, it\u2019s too late to turn back.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to be a Mormon missionary for 2 years of my life.</p> <p>After I assured my mom that everything was fine, she left. Then I placed all my things into my comically large suitcase. It\u2019s a strange thing, living out of a suitcase for 2 years, constantly moving from place to place, never really having somewhere to call home. Just drifting in and out of people's stories without a care in the world. Why fully unpack your things when you\u2019re just going to have to move again? Then again, why even think about unpacking a suitcase right now? I just finished packing. There\u2019s a million things I still needed to get done, yet all I could seem to muster the energy to do was sit on the edge of my bed and stare at my suitcase.</p> <p>What I\u2019m describing isn\u2019t unique; thousands of people decide to go on missions every year. You're treated with honor and respect, and you return home a local hero. God has commanded to go and teach the world the truth. We sing about this moment in church when we're children. I hope they call me on a mission, when I have grown a foot or two. People do this kind of thing because they genuinely believe in what they\u2019re teaching.</p> <p></p> <p>I went on a mission because I believed in the Mormon church. I believed, perhaps naively, that the Mormon church was the only true church on the planet. I taught people about Joseph Smith. I baptized people. I knocked on lots and lots of doors. I listened to cheesy Christian bands. I handed out the Book of Mormon. I called my family twice a year. I prayed every night. I went to bed at 10:30. I got 8 hours of sleep. I played a lot of basketball. I wrote in my journal.</p> <p>I was a good Mormon missionary.</p> <p>Growing up we were taught that people who stop believing are \u201cdeceived by Satan\u201d or \u201cfell for anti-Mormon literature\u201d or \u201cwere lazy and just wanted to sin\u201d or \u201cwere offended by the people\u201d etc, etc\u2026</p> <p>So then did any of those things happen to me?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>I left because the Mormon church isn\u2019t true.</p> <p>They\u2019ll tell you about all of these \"reasons\" that people leave to try and discredit the people who left. The truth is, in order to honestly comprehend that people leave the Mormon church because of flaws in it's history or doctrine, means admitting that those flaws exist in the first place. The Mormon church, however, has no flaws, at least according to them.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never forget the time I found out the Mormon church lied to me.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way an uneducated farm boy could write such a complicated and convincing tale as the Book of Mormon in only 60 days! It had to have come from God!\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ll hear this argument a lot. I have heard this argument more times than I can count. I told this to people while on my mission.</p> <p>I would like to now turn your attention away from the Book of Mormon briefly, and towards a different book, in a different time. One that was published a decade prior to the release of the Book of Mormon. This book is titled The Late War. It\u2019s a historical textbook written in an old style of English, similar to that of the Book of Mormon. So similar, in fact, that doing a side by side comparison reveals a singularly laughable fact. Large swaths of the Book of Mormon were very clearly plagiarized from this book. Not only that, but this was a book that is widely believed to have been owned by Joseph Smith himself.</p> <p>There I was, a struggling college student in my studio apartment, doing the side by side comparison of the two books whilst my newborn son napped in the crib behind me. My jaw hung open in disbelief as I read. \u201cThe single most important piece of evidence for the restoration of the gospel\u201d was falling apart right in front of me. My brain broke. The glass chair I was sitting on shattered and I was suddenly falling 168 stories to my death. The world started to spin.</p> <p>I know it sounds a bit hyperbolic but my whole entire belief system came crashing down. There was nothing left. I stood there in the ashes wondering what I could possibly rebuild with.</p> <p>To this day my parents think I \u201cread some anti Mormon stuff online.\u201d We don\u2019t really talk about it. Maybe we never will. They\u2019ve dedicated close to half a century worth of time to the Mormon church. I was lucky enough to learn the truth in my early twenties, I can\u2019t image what it would do to a person in their sixties. Perhaps it\u2019s better if they never learn the truth. All their friends, large chunks of their identity, and their whole community is Mormon. Maybe they\u2019d be too proud to listen to what I have to say. I don\u2019t even know if I want to try to tell them.</p> <p>I wanted the church to be true. I wanted the community, I miss the community. I miss knowing \u201cwhat the purpose of life is.\u201d I wanted to believe in continuing revelation and modern day prophets. I loved the beautiful bubble that was Utah county. I enjoyed going to church and singing weird cult-y songs about Joseph Smith being a Martyr. But it\u2019s impossible to unsee something.</p> <p>Once you pull back the curtain to reveal a man operating the levers to what you once believed moments ago was a great and powerful wizard, you can\u2019t just close the curtain and pretend everything is fine.</p> <p>Ignorance is bliss.</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/personal/","title":"Personal","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/religion/","title":"Religion","text":""}]}
